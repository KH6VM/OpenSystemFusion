What is OpenSystemFusion?

It is an open source project to create a network of users that is not dependant on the continued existance of the Yaesu Wires-X server, though one future goal is to be able to interact with the manufacturer's system if such is permitted. It will consist of Radio node software (SystemFusionRepeater), a gateway (SFircDDBGateway) based on the ircDDB system used by the OpenDV project hosted here on Github (https://github.com/dl5di/OpenDV) and a DExtra Reflector (SFReflector) network.
